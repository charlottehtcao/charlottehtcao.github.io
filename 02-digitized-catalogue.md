title: Digitized Ker Catalogue
---
This set of files, prepared by Stanford University research interns led by Eyup Eren Yurek and managed by Elaine Treharne, are the preliminary materials for a fully digital Catalogue of Manuscripts containing Early English (an updated version of Neil R. Ker’s original Catalogue of Manuscripts containing Anglo-Saxon [Oxford, 1957]). Each file contains information about the Ker Item number and manuscript shelfmark, arranged alphabetically by city and repository. We give Ker’s date, provenance, and title, plus his description, augmenting this with scholarship from Helmut Gneuss and Michael Lapidge’s *A bibliographical handlist of manuscripts and manuscript fragments written or owned in England up to 1100* (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2013), the DigiPal link (https://www.digipal.eu/digipal, by Peter Stokes and Stewart Brookes), and *The Production and Use of English Manuscripts, 1060 to 1220* (https://em1060.stanford.edu/, by Elaine Treharne, Orietta Da Rold, Takako Kato, Mary Swan, and Georgia Henley).

There are numerous abbreviations and shortened bibliographical titles here, and these can be interpreted by glancing at Ker’s original Catalogue on the webpages here, and by following the links to the projects just listed. Links to images are provided (though as of 31 August 2024, the British Library digitised manuscripts website is still not functioning).

Additional materials for interpreting Ker’s detailed and meticulous findings will be provided in the months to come. It should be noted that the use of the word ‘Provenance’ here subsumes ‘Localization’ and ‘Provenance,’ following Ker’s own use of the terms. The different projects—Gneuss and Lapidge, EM1060 to 1220, and Ker—sometimes have different views about date and localization/provenance and we provide information in brackets about this.
