Stanford Text Technologies, with the support of Stanford’s Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis and the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education, has been working since 2022 on producing an updated, and now digital, version of Neil Ripley Ker’s *Catalogue of Manuscripts containing Anglo-Saxon*, which was published by Clarendon Press in 1957. Originally intended for Oxford University Press, this is now an Open Access resource: manipulable and quantifiable data is augmented with additional material on Neil Ker himself, on his publications, his previously unpublished archival sources, and contemporary scholarship that has advanced Ker’s foundational work.

## Acknowledgements
We wish to acknowledge the initial assistance of Dr Stewart Brookes, with whom discussions were held about what manuscript description template might be most efficient, and what kind of updating and editorial intervention would be most useful. The Stanford team has made its own editorial decisions subsequently. Dr Brookes also supplied the project team with a handful of PDFs of relevant modern publications. We are grateful to Oxford University Press for their general interest in the project and for their good wishes with this stage of our work. We’d like to thank CESTA and its many faculty and student collaborators; medieval manuscript scholars Professor Julia Crick, Professor David Rundle, and Dr James Willoughby; the Bodleian Library’s Dr Martin Kauffmann and Dr Matthew Holford; and Professors Orietta Da Rold, Francis Leneghan, Andrew Prescott, and Greg Walker.
