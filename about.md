Stanford Text Technologies, with the support of Stanford’s Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis and the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education, has been working since 2022 on producing an updated, and now digital, version of Neil Ripley Ker’s Catalogue of Manuscripts containing Anglo-Saxon, which was published by Clarendon Press in 1957. Originally intended for Oxford University Press, this is now an Open Access resource: manipulable and quantifiable data is augmented with additional material on Neil Ker himself, on his publications, his previously unpublished archival sources, and contemporary scholarship that has advanced Ker’s foundational work.

## Meet the Team

**Elaine Treharne** is the Principal Investigator for *DigitalKer*. She is the Roberta Bowman Denning Professor of Humanities, Professor of English, and Robert K. Packard Fellow in Undergraduate Education. She has published more than eighty articles and thirty books, generally focused on Old and Middle English and Manuscript Studies. She has run several major, externally-funded, research projects, and is currently working on a number of new book projects. She has long respected and been awed by Ker’s exceptional scholarly record and brilliance.

**Eyup Eren Yurek** has been the first undergraduate researcher to work on this project and has worked as the project manager on it, all starting the Spring of 2022. A graduate of a Bachelor's in Comparative Literature and a Master's in German Studies from Stanford University, Eren works on connections between critical and cultural theory and poetic form, and textual materiality, as well as the ways narrative exists in all parts of our lives. He is currently the Programs and Research Coordinator at CESTA (Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis), running programs and developing events for scholars and students interested in questions between computational and digital methods, and humanistic inquiry.

**Charlotte Cao**, a rising sophomore at Stanford, was the summer 2024 CESTA intern for the Text Technologies project. During her internship, she worked to build the *DigitalKer* website, digitize the *Catalogue*, and create visualizations using data collected from the *Catalogue* itself. Outside of research, she enjoys reading and writing, exploring cafes around the area, and going to art museums. She is incredibly grateful to have been given this research opportunity and for having had the privilege of working with such a phenomenal team.

## Acknowledgements
We wish to acknowledge the initial assistance of Dr Stewart Brookes, with whom discussions were held about what manuscript description template might be most efficient, and what kind of updating and editorial intervention would be most useful. The Stanford team has made its own editorial decisions subsequently. Dr Brookes also supplied the project team with a handful of PDFs of relevant modern publications. We are grateful to Oxford University Press for their general interest in the project and for their good wishes with this stage of our work. We’d like to thank CESTA and its many faculty and student collaborators; medieval manuscript scholars Professor Julia Crick, Professor David Rundle, and Dr James Willoughby; the Bodleian Library’s Dr Martin Kauffmann and Dr Matthew Holford; and Professors Orietta Da Rold, Francis Leneghan, Andrew Prescott, and Greg Walker.
