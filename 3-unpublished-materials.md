title: Unpublished Materials
---
Neil Ripley Ker’s archive, much of which is kept at Oxford, Bodleian Library, is housed as MSS 20510/ 1-78, and contains extensive materials relating to his palaeographical and linguistic research. This website will host editions of numerous previously unpublished lectures and notes written by Neil Ker during his extensive career. These have been transcribed by Stanford University undergraduate researchers named in the first footnote of the edited PDFs (thanks so very much to Creagh Factor for her outstanding work in the Summer of 2024). Elaine Treharne has edited these materials, lightly expanding Ker’s abbreviations; slightly emending his punctuation for a written, rather than spoken, context of production; adding footnotes to explain or query his marginal comments and interlineations; and providing information about various people, publications, and manuscripts cited. There is more work to be done on the latter, and these should be considered preliminary editions of his materials.

Thanks to the kindness of the Bodleian Library’s Head of Early and Rare Collections—Dr Martin Kauffmann—for his permission to research the Neil Ker archive and bring it to public attention here.
