## Acknowledgements
We wish to acknowledge the initial assistance of Dr Stewart Brookes, with whom discussions were held about what manuscript description template might be most efficient, and what kind of updating and editorial intervention would be most useful. The Stanford team has made its own editorial decisions subsequently. Dr Brookes also supplied the project team with a handful of PDFs of relevant modern publications. We are grateful to Oxford University Press for their general interest in the project and for their good wishes with this stage of our work. We’d like to thank CESTA and its many faculty and student collaborators; medieval manuscript scholars Professor Julia Crick, Professor David Rundle, and Dr James Willoughby; the Bodleian Library’s Dr Martin Kauffmann and Dr Matthew Holford; and Professors Orietta Da Rold, Francis Leneghan, Andrew Prescott, and Greg Walker.
